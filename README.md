Please note the key features:

1.  Fully responsive Chlorophyll - The Nursery section.  Resize window to view desktop and mobile versions of The Nursery.  All custom design, layout, and CSS.
2.  Use of jQuery datatables with sortable columns, search functionality, pagination, and selectable entry count.
3.  Inside the code for index.html, you will see commented out sections referring to the server-side JSON call.  I have provided the JSON file that would be used in this case, but it is NOT being referenced as you will be loading the build locally.
4.  Photoshop PSD File containing construction pieces, and two JPG screen shots of potential page builds.
